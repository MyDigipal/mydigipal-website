## The Challenge

In the crowded digital analytics market, Quantum Metrics faced the classic B2B challenge: reaching the right people at the right companies with messages that actually resonate. Traditional demand generation wasn't cutting it—they needed precision targeting that could drive real pipeline impact.

## Our Approach

### Account Selection & Research

We started by working closely with Quantum Metrics' sales team to identify their ideal customer profile and build a target account list. This wasn't just about company size or industry—we dug deep into technographic data, intent signals, and organizational structures.

### Multi-Channel ABM Execution

Our strategy combined:

- **LinkedIn Advertising**: Precision-targeted campaigns reaching decision-makers and influencers at target accounts
- **Programmatic Display**: Retargeting and awareness campaigns keeping Quantum Metrics top-of-mind
- **Personalized Content**: Tailored messaging for different personas and buying stages

### Continuous Optimization

ABM isn't "set and forget." We continuously analyzed engagement data, refined audience segments, and optimized creative based on real performance metrics.

## The Results

The impact was significant across all key metrics:

- **60% increase in click-through rates** compared to previous campaigns
- **25% reduction in cost per lead** through better targeting
- **30% faster deal velocity** for accounts engaged through the ABM program

## Key Learnings

Success in ABM comes from the combination of precision targeting, compelling content, and relentless optimization. By treating each target account as a market of one, we were able to drive meaningful engagement that translated directly to pipeline acceleration.
