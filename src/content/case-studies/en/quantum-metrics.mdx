## The Challenge

In the crowded digital analytics market, Quantum Metrics faced the classic B2B challenge: reaching the right people at the right companies with messages that actually resonate. Traditional demand generation wasn't cutting it—they needed precision targeting that could drive real pipeline impact.

Their marketing team was generating leads, but the quality wasn't there. Sales cycles were long, and too many opportunities stalled because initial engagement didn't reach the right stakeholders. They needed a fundamental shift from volume-based marketing to value-based engagement.

## Our Approach

We implemented a comprehensive [Account-Based Marketing (ABM)](/en/services/b2b-abm) strategy that aligned marketing and sales around high-value target accounts. This wasn't just running ads—it was a complete transformation in how Quantum Metrics approached their market.

### Account Selection & Research

We started by working closely with Quantum Metrics' sales team to identify their ideal customer profile and build a target account list. This wasn't just about company size or industry—we dug deep into technographic data, intent signals, and organizational structures.

Our research process included:
- **Firmographic Analysis**: Identifying companies with the right size, revenue, and growth trajectory
- **Technographic Mapping**: Understanding what tools and platforms target accounts already used
- **Intent Signal Monitoring**: Tracking which accounts were actively researching digital analytics solutions
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Mapping decision-makers, influencers, and champions at each account

### Multi-Channel ABM Execution

Our [paid social strategy](/en/services/paid-social) combined multiple touchpoints to create a surround-sound effect for target accounts:

- **LinkedIn Advertising**: Precision-targeted campaigns reaching decision-makers and influencers at target accounts using LinkedIn's account targeting combined with job title layering
- **Programmatic Display**: Retargeting and awareness campaigns keeping Quantum Metrics top-of-mind across premium business publications
- **Personalized Content**: Tailored messaging for different personas—technical content for practitioners, ROI-focused content for executives

### Sales & Marketing Alignment

A critical component was establishing tight alignment between marketing and sales through weekly pipeline reviews, shared dashboards showing marketing touchpoints by account, and coordinated outreach timing to maximize impact.

### Continuous Optimization

ABM isn't "set and forget." We continuously analyzed engagement data, refined audience segments, and optimized creative based on real performance metrics with daily bid adjustments, weekly creative reviews, and monthly account list refinement.

## The Results

The impact was significant across all key metrics:

- **60% increase in click-through rates** compared to previous campaigns
- **25% reduction in cost per lead** through better targeting
- **30% faster deal velocity** for accounts engaged through the ABM program
- **Higher average deal size** from engaging multiple stakeholders early

## Key Learnings

Success in ABM comes from the combination of precision targeting, compelling content, and relentless optimization. By treating each target account as a market of one, we were able to drive meaningful engagement that translated directly to pipeline acceleration.

The biggest insight? ABM isn't just a marketing tactic—it's a go-to-market strategy that requires commitment from both marketing and sales. When both teams align around the same accounts with coordinated efforts, the results speak for themselves.
