## The Challenge

GWI provides audience research data to some of the world's largest brands and agencies. Their ideal customers are senior marketing professionals and insights leaders at enterprise organizations—a sophisticated audience that has seen every marketing tactic in the book.

Generic demand generation wasn't working. They needed campaigns that would cut through the noise and demonstrate real understanding of their prospects' challenges.

## Our Approach

### Deep Account Research

Before launching any campaigns, we invested heavily in understanding GWI's target accounts:

- Mapping organizational structures and key decision-makers
- Understanding each account's current data and insights stack
- Identifying specific use cases where GWI could add value

### Persona-Based Messaging

We developed distinct messaging tracks for different buyer personas:

- **CMOs & Marketing Leaders**: Focused on strategic advantage and competitive intelligence
- **Insights & Research Managers**: Emphasized data quality and methodology
- **Media & Planning Teams**: Highlighted audience understanding and targeting capabilities

### Multi-Touch Execution

Our campaign architecture included:

- **LinkedIn Sponsored Content**: Thought leadership reaching key personas
- **LinkedIn InMail**: Personalized outreach at scale
- **Programmatic Display**: Awareness and retargeting across the web
- **Content Syndication**: Targeted distribution of high-value content

## The Results

The tailored approach delivered significant improvements:

- **85% increase in engagement rates** compared to previous generic campaigns
- **2.5x pipeline influenced** by ABM-touched accounts
- **40% improvement in MQL to SQL conversion** due to better lead quality

## What Made It Work

Success came from the combination of thorough research, genuine personalization, and persistent multi-channel engagement. When prospects saw messaging that clearly understood their specific challenges, engagement followed naturally.

The key was treating ABM as a true marketing-sales partnership—using marketing to warm accounts and create opportunities, while arming sales with the insights they needed to have meaningful conversations.
