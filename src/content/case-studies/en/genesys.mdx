## The challenge

Genesys operates in one of the most competitive B2B technology markets—cloud customer experience solutions. Their target audience includes CIOs, customer experience leaders, and IT decision-makers at large enterprises who are constantly bombarded with vendor outreach.

With enterprise deals involving 12-18 month sales cycles and 6-10 stakeholders per deal, they needed marketing that could:

- Cut through competitive noise from well-funded rivals
- Build meaningful relationships with key accounts before sales outreach
- Support sales through the complex buying journey with relevant touchpoints
- Demonstrate clear ROI on marketing investment to justify the budget

Traditional demand generation was producing leads, but the quality wasn't there. Sales was spending too much time qualifying leads that weren't ready to buy, and too many opportunities stalled mid-funnel.

## Our strategy

We implemented a comprehensive [Account-Based Marketing (ABM)](/en/services/b2b-abm) strategy designed specifically for enterprise B2B technology sales. This wasn't about generating more leads—it was about creating better opportunities.

### Account prioritization & research

We worked with Genesys to develop a tiered account structure based on revenue potential, strategic fit, and likelihood to close:

- **Tier 1 (50 accounts)**: Strategic accounts receiving fully personalized 1:1 campaigns with custom content and dedicated resources
- **Tier 2 (200 accounts)**: High-value accounts with segment-level personalization based on industry and company size
- **Tier 3 (1,000+ accounts)**: Growth accounts with industry-level targeting using programmatic approaches

For each tier, we mapped out the buying committee—identifying the economic buyer, technical evaluators, end users, and potential champions—so we could target the right messages to the right people.

### Content that resonates

Rather than generic product messaging, we developed content programs around specific pain points and use cases:

- **Industry-Specific Challenges**: Tailored perspectives for retail (omnichannel experiences), financial services (compliance + CX), healthcare (patient experience), and tech (developer experience)
- **Thought Leadership**: Executive-level insights on the future of customer experience, AI in contact centers, and workforce optimization
- **Proof Points**: Customer success stories relevant to each target segment, showing ROI and implementation timelines
- **Interactive Tools**: ROI calculators and assessment tools that engaged prospects while gathering intent data

### Multi-channel orchestrated execution

Our [paid social strategy](/en/services/paid-social) combined multiple touchpoints to create a surround-sound effect for target accounts:

- **LinkedIn Advertising**: Primary channel for reaching decision-makers with account-based targeting, job function layering, and seniority filters. We ran thought leadership sponsored content, lead gen forms, and InMail sequences for Tier 1 accounts.
- **Programmatic Display**: Awareness building through premium B2B publications and retargeting across the web to stay top-of-mind during long evaluation cycles
- **Content Syndication**: Reaching new contacts within target accounts with gated content like industry reports and analyst papers
- **Direct Outreach Support**: Providing sales with account intelligence dashboards, engagement scoring, and coordinated timing for personalized outreach

### Sales & marketing alignment

A critical success factor was establishing tight alignment between marketing and sales:

- **Weekly Pipeline Reviews**: Joint sessions to discuss account progression and adjust targeting
- **Shared Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into marketing touchpoints by account
- **Lead Scoring**: Behavioral and firmographic scoring to prioritize sales outreach
- **Coordinated Timing**: Marketing "air cover" before and during sales outreach windows

## The results

The strategic approach delivered measurable impact across the funnel:

- **92% increase in account engagement** across target accounts, with 3+ stakeholders per account actively consuming content
- **3x improvement in meeting bookings** from ABM-touched accounts compared to cold outbound
- **55% lift in brand awareness** within target segments measured through brand search volume and survey data
- **28% shorter sales cycles** for opportunities influenced by ABM campaigns
- **Higher deal sizes** with multi-stakeholder engagement established before sales conversations

## The amplification effect

What made this program particularly successful was the amplification effect—each channel reinforced the others. Prospects saw consistent, relevant messaging across LinkedIn, display ads, industry publications, and content syndication partners. This created familiarity and credibility before sales conversations began.

When sales reached out, they weren't cold calling. They were continuing a conversation that marketing had already started. Prospects often referenced specific content pieces or thanked the team for "useful insights" they'd seen in their feeds.

## Campaign optimization & iteration

ABM isn't "set and forget." We continuously analyzed engagement data and refined our approach:

- **Daily**: Bid adjustments and budget reallocation based on performance
- **Weekly**: Creative refresh and A/B testing of messaging angles
- **Monthly**: Account list refinement based on intent signals and sales feedback
- **Quarterly**: Full strategy reviews with Genesys leadership to align on priorities

## Key learnings

Enterprise ABM success requires patience, coordination, and commitment. The accounts with the highest deal values often have the longest sales cycles—but they're also the most receptive to sustained, valuable engagement.

Three lessons stood out:

1. **Quality over quantity**: Focusing on fewer, better-fit accounts generated more pipeline than broad targeting
2. **Multi-stakeholder engagement**: Reaching 3+ contacts per account dramatically improved deal velocity
3. **Sales-marketing alignment**: The programs that worked best had daily collaboration between teams

By maintaining consistent, value-adding engagement throughout the buyer journey, we helped Genesys win deals that might otherwise have gone to competitors.
