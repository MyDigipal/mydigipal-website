## The Challenge

Genesys operates in one of the most competitive B2B technology markets. With enterprise deals involving long sales cycles and multiple stakeholders, they needed marketing that could:

- Cut through competitive noise
- Build meaningful relationships with key accounts
- Support sales through the complex buying journey
- Demonstrate clear ROI on marketing investment

## Our Strategy

### Account Prioritization

We worked with Genesys to develop a tiered account structure:

- **Tier 1**: Strategic accounts receiving fully personalized campaigns
- **Tier 2**: High-value accounts with segment-level personalization
- **Tier 3**: Growth accounts with industry-level targeting

### Content That Resonates

Rather than generic product messaging, we developed content programs around:

- **Industry-Specific Challenges**: Tailored perspectives for retail, financial services, healthcare, and tech
- **Thought Leadership**: Executive-level insights on the future of customer experience
- **Proof Points**: Customer success stories relevant to each target segment

### Orchestrated Execution

Our multi-channel approach included:

- **LinkedIn**: Primary channel for reaching decision-makers
- **Programmatic Display**: Awareness building and retargeting
- **Content Syndication**: Reaching new audiences with gated content
- **Direct Outreach Support**: Providing sales with account intelligence and air cover

## The Results

The strategic approach delivered measurable impact:

- **92% increase in account engagement** across target accounts
- **3x improvement in meeting bookings** from ABM-touched accounts
- **55% lift in brand awareness** within target segments

## The Amplification Effect

What made this program particularly successful was the amplification effect—each channel reinforced the others. Prospects saw consistent, relevant messaging across touchpoints, building familiarity and trust before sales conversations began.

When sales reached out, they weren't cold calling. They were continuing a conversation that marketing had already started.

## Lessons Learned

Enterprise ABM success requires patience, coordination, and commitment. The accounts with the highest deal values often have the longest sales cycles. By maintaining consistent, value-adding engagement throughout that journey, we helped Genesys win deals that might otherwise have gone to competitors.
