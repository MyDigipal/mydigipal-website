## The Challenge

Theobald Group operates one of the largest dealership networks in their region, with 31 locations representing multiple automotive brands. Their previous approach to digital marketing was fragmented—each dealership essentially running its own campaigns with little coordination.

This led to:
- Inconsistent brand messaging
- Cannibalization between dealership campaigns
- Inefficient budget allocation
- No cross-location insights or learnings

## Our Solution

### Centralized Strategy, Local Execution

We developed a hub-and-spoke model for their digital marketing:

- **Central Brand Campaigns**: Unified messaging and creative that built overall brand awareness
- **Local Performance Campaigns**: Dealership-specific campaigns optimized for local inventory and market conditions
- **Smart Budget Allocation**: Dynamic budget distribution based on performance and opportunity

### Platform-Specific Excellence

#### Google Ads
We restructured their Google Ads account architecture to eliminate internal competition and maximize quality scores. Smart bidding strategies ensured optimal bid adjustments across locations and audiences.

#### Facebook Ads
Our Facebook strategy focused on:
- **Dynamic Vehicle Ads**: Showcasing real-time inventory to interested buyers
- **Lookalike Audiences**: Scaling reach to users similar to past converters
- **Retargeting**: Bringing back website visitors with compelling offers

#### LinkedIn Ads
For their B2B fleet and corporate sales initiatives, LinkedIn provided the perfect channel to reach decision-makers at target companies.

### Advanced Attribution

We implemented cross-channel attribution modeling that gave Theobald Group true visibility into the customer journey, from first ad impression to showroom visit.

## The Results

The unified approach delivered exceptional results:

- **112% increase in Google Ads conversions** through better structure and bidding
- **125% increase in Facebook conversions** with dynamic creative and audiences
- **50% reduction in cost per conversion** across all channels
- **63% growth in website traffic** from improved campaign performance
- **35% improvement in LinkedIn conversion rate** for B2B initiatives

## The Efficiency Gains

Perhaps most importantly, the centralized approach freed up significant time for the marketing team. Instead of managing 31 separate efforts, they could focus on strategy and optimization while our automated systems handled the execution.

## Key Insights

Scale doesn't have to mean complexity. With the right strategy and systems, managing digital marketing for multiple locations can actually become more efficient than managing a single one—with each location benefiting from learnings across the network.
