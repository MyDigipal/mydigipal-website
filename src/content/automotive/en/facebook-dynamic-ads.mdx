## DMD Group Success Story

DMD Group, a cornerstone of the automotive industry in the Grand Ouest region since 1934, faced the challenge of adapting to modern online sales demands. With over 45 dealerships and 1,000+ vehicles in stock, they needed a solution to seamlessly promote their inventory online.

### The Challenge

Competing in a crowded market, DMD sought to optimize their marketing strategy to:
- Boost visibility for their extensive vehicle stock
- Reach the right audience with personalized ads
- Drive measurable results while minimizing costs

### The Solution

Using Facebook Dynamic Ads (FDA), DMD automated their ad campaigns to dynamically showcase real-time inventory updates. Targeted promotions such as "Offer of the Week" and "Offer of the Month" enhanced engagement while tailored ads catered to specific demographics and price ranges.

### Expand Beyond Meta with Google

Dynamic ads aren't just for Meta—they're also available on Google Ads. By leveraging Google Dynamic Ads, you can expand your reach and engage potential buyers at key moments in their purchasing journey.
