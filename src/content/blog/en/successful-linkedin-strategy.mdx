LinkedIn has consistently been a reliable and efficient B2B channel. The main advantage is the targeting—very few other channels offer the ability to precisely target companies, industries, or specific job titles.

## Target the Right Audience

The starting point is to find the right targeting:
- Broad enough to have scale (LinkedIn recommends 50k+, we see results from 15k+)
- Not too broad to maintain qualification
- Leverage first-party data and contact lists

Cross Job functions, seniorities, interests, company lists, and exclusions. AB test your audiences to find what works best.

## Leverage Retargeting

We recommend:
- Retargeting website visitors
- Retargeting prospects who interacted with top-of-funnel ads
- Creating sub-remarketing audiences based on content type

## Provide Custom and Valuable Content

LinkedIn is competitive. You need to:
- Understand your target audience's pain points
- Create customized and valuable content
- Come up with copy and visuals that resonate

## Leverage Organic Content and Thought-Leadership Ads

A successful strategy doesn't only rely on company ads:
- Organic content comes across as more genuine
- Thought-leadership ads are less pushy
- Consider LinkedIn Ad Boosting for high-performing posts

## Track and Iterate

Key tracking requirements:
- **Website tracking**: LinkedIn Insight tag (Consent Mode V2 compliant)
- **Automation system**: Lead scoring and personalized content delivery

## Conclusion

While LinkedIn can be challenging, it remains an extremely powerful B2B channel offering unique targeting capabilities. Used efficiently with an organic and personalized experience, it can provide great efficiency for B2B companies.
