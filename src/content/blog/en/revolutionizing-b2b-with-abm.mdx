## Where Does ABM Come From?

ABM—or my preferred label, ABX (X for Experience or Everything)—has been around for about a decade and seen strong adoption over the last 5 years. Most companies that have deployed ABM practices have enjoyed solid results.

ABM also gets marketing focus away from generating individual leads (MQLs) which have had a chequered reputation within sales organisations. It is a much more targeted process and therefore a much more cost effective way to engage prospects.

## ABM to Reach Your Total Addressable Market

At any given point in time, only about 3% to 8% of your TAM is actually in market. That means that about 95% is not!

In recent years, marketers have struggled because:
- PLG strategies are no longer delivering sufficient lead volume
- Brand awareness campaigns aren't designed to progress accounts through the funnel
- There is complete saturation of generic outbound channels

## What Is ABM 2.0?

ABM 2.0 leverages many signals to better identify, understand, target, and prioritize audiences:
- **Firmographics**
- **Technographics**
- **Industry segments**
- **Behavioral signals** (Dynamic ICP markers)

By understanding buyer triggers like new executives, funding rounds, or new regulations, you can build highly targeted accounts with personalized messages.

## What Can ABM Deliver?

- **2x** Pipeline conversion rate
- **25%** Improvement in deal velocity
- **45%** Increase in marketing engaged bookings

## Conclusion

Account-Based Experience is transforming the marketing landscape by prioritizing personalization and targeted engagement.
