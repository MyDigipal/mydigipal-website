## Understanding Intent Data

Intent Data is revolutionizing how businesses understand potential leads. It's about capturing the pulse of potential leads as they research and engage with content relevant to your products or services, even outside your direct digital footprint.

However, navigating through the complexities of Intent Data is not straightforward. With a myriad of tools available, choosing the right solution requires careful consideration.

## Setting Up a Successful Intent Strategy

The first step is selecting a tool that aligns with your business needs. The chosen tool should:
- Cover your target geographies
- Offer data enrichment to fill in gaps about leads
- Integrate seamlessly with other digital marketing channels

## Combining Intent with Engagement

Platforms like Demandbase and 6sense offer capabilities to merge Intent Data with popular marketing platforms such as Marketo and Salesforce.

## The Overselling of Intent Data

Despite its apparent benefits, there's a growing gap between the promised quality of Intent Data and what it actually delivers. Instances of failed campaigns highlight this discrepancy.

## The Future: AI Integration

The integration of AI promises a deeper understanding of nuanced customer behaviors and predictive analytics for customer journey mapping. Real-time intent data processing is poised to make Intent Data more accurate than ever.

## Conclusion

Marketers need to blend intent signals with broader engagement data to create campaigns that are truly effective.
