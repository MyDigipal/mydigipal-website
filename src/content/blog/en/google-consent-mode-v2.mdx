"We're compliant, we've got a banner on our site!" 🤡

Many website owners believe their sites comply with data privacy laws simply because they have a cookie banner. However, upon auditing the data flow, we often discover this isn't the case.

## What Is Google Consent Mode V2?

Google Consent Mode V2 is an advanced evolution of Google's cookie policies designed to respect user privacy while maintaining a secure online experience. This update, mandatory by March 2024, is crucial for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## Why Is Compliance Essential?

**FACT**: Despite the presence of cookie banners, many websites fail to comply with privacy regulations due to improper data flow management.

**CHALLENGE**: Non-compliance can result in severe legal repercussions, including hefty fines and loss of consumer trust.

**SOLUTION**: Google Consent Mode V2 simplifies compliance by offering an automated solution that adjusts data flow based on user consent.

## How to Implement

### Option 1: CMP Compliance

Using a Consent Management Platform (CMP) that complies with regulations ensures peace of mind:
- Cookiebot (preferred option)
- CookieYes
- iubenda
- Axeptio

### Option 2: Manual Implementation via GTM

Manual implementation through Google Tag Manager does not require a subscription but requires technical expertise.

## Potential Consequences of Non-Compliance

- **Impact on Google Ads Campaigns**: Restrictions or bans on running Google Ads campaigns
- **Data Visibility in GA4**: Loss of access to critical data
- **Legal and Financial Risks**: Substantial fines and legal actions
