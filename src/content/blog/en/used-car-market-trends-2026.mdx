The European used car market is undergoing its most significant transformation in decades. With new car prices rising 15% faster than used values, supply chain disruptions reshaping inventory, and electric vehicles creating unprecedented depreciation patterns, dealerships must adapt or risk obsolescence.

According to [Autovista Group](https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/news/which-european-used-car-markets-are-performing-the-best-so-far-2025/), used-car transactions across Spain, Italy, the UK, Germany, and France all saw growth, outperforming their respective new-car markets.

This guide analyzes the key trends shaping the used car landscape in 2026 and provides actionable strategies for dealerships.

The French market shows particular strength in vehicles over 10 years old, with transactions in this age group up 11%—partially compensating for the shortage of younger used cars caused by years of new-car market struggles.
