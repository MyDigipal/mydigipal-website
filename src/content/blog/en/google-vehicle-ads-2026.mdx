Car dealerships are leaving money on the table. While competitors fight over expensive generic keywords at €30-80 per lead, smart dealers are generating qualified showroom visits at **€5-15 per lead** using Google Vehicle Ads (GVA).

According to [Google's official documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/11189169), Vehicle Ads help you get in front of auto shoppers at the right moment, with the right listings and information to move them closer to a purchase.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to dominate Google Vehicle Ads in 2026—including the critical pricing compliance rules now in full effect.

## What Are Google Vehicle Ads?

Google Vehicle Ads automatically display your inventory directly in Google Search and Shopping results. Unlike traditional text ads, they showcase:

| Element | What Users See |
|---------|---------------|
| Vehicle image | High-quality photo of the actual car |
| Make & model | "2024 BMW X5 xDrive40i" |
| Price | Real price (compliance required) |
| Mileage | For used vehicles |
| Dealer name | Your dealership brand |
| Location | Distance from searcher |

When a user searches "BMW X5 near me" or "used SUV under €30,000," your actual inventory appears—not a generic ad hoping the user finds what they want.

### Availability by Region

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| United States | Fully available |
| Canada | Fully available |
| Australia | Fully available |
| United Kingdom | Fully available |
| France | Fully available |
| Netherlands | Fully available |
| Germany | Open beta |

For dealerships in France, adoption is still relatively low—representing a major competitive advantage for early movers.
