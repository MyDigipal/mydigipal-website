## Why Training Your Team on Using AI Is a Priority Today

We've entered a new era. AI isn't coming, it's already here. And it's not going away.

The companies that embrace this shift gain a critical edge. They save time. Reduce errors. Move faster. But tools alone don't drive transformation. People do.

## What Employees Can Do with AI: Use Cases That Matter

- **Marketing & Comms**: Write LinkedIn posts, summarise reports, localise content, create first drafts
- **Retail & Customer Care**: Respond to FAQs, summarise feedback, generate call scripts
- **HR & Legal**: Draft job ads, summarise CVs, rephrase legal clauses
- **Finance & Operations**: Clean up Excel data, check formulas, generate dashboards

## The CRAFT Method for Better Prompting

- **C – Context**: What's the situation or background?
- **R – Role**: Who is the AI supposed to act as?
- **A – Action**: What do you want it to do?
- **F – Format**: What should the output look like?
- **T – Tone**: How should it sound?

Example: "You work in a healthcare company as a recruitment specialist. Write a job ad for a marketing analyst. Make it concise and friendly, formatted as a LinkedIn post."

## Building an Internal AI Council

Every AI-literate company needs a team responsible for developing more complex, custom solutions. Their role is to go beyond prompting and experiment with advanced integrations: API connections, autonomous agents, workflow automation.

## From AI Training to Long-Term Impact

Adoption sticks when employees feel confident. When they're given the right guardrails—and the freedom to explore.
