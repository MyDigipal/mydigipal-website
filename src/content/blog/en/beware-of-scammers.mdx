**Important Security Notice**: It has come to our attention that organized scammers are impersonating MyDigipal to deceive individuals with fake job opportunities. This fraudulent activity has affected people across multiple countries, and we are actively working with law enforcement to shut down these operations.

This article provides everything you need to know to protect yourself and report suspicious activity.

## How the Scam Works

The scammers have developed a sophisticated multi-stage scheme designed to build trust before extracting money from victims:

### Stage 1: Initial Contact

- Scammers reach out via **WhatsApp, Telegram, or SMS**
- They claim to represent a recruitment agency affiliated with MyDigipal (names like "Deluxe Recruitment," "Elite Digital Hiring," or similar)
- The initial message often promises high-paying remote work with flexible hours
- They may reference our legitimate website or social media to appear credible

### Stage 2: The Hook

- Victims are directed to fraudulent websites that closely mimic our official site
- Job offers seem too good to be true: high pay, no experience required, work from anywhere
- The "jobs" typically involve simple tasks like rating products, liking social media posts, or data entry
- Initial small "payments" may be made to build trust

### Stage 3: The Scam

- After a brief period, victims are asked to "invest" or pay fees to unlock higher-paying tasks
- Requests escalate from small amounts to larger sums
- When victims try to withdraw earnings, they face additional "fees" or "taxes"
- Eventually, all communication stops once significant money has been extracted

## Red Flags to Watch For

| Legitimate MyDigipal | Scam Operation |
