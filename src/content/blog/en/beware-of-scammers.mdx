It has come to our attention that a group of scammers is impersonating MyDigipal to deceive individuals by offering fake job opportunities. Their scheme is highly elaborate, and they operate as follows:

- They initially contact people via WhatsApp, pretending to be a recruitment agency part of MyDigipal group (Deluxe Recruitment is a name they've used for example).
- They direct victims to fraudulent websites that closely resemble our official site
- They offer easy online jobs that require no prior experience.
- Very quickly, they start requesting money, and that's where the scam begins.

We have successfully taken down multiple fraudulent websites, but new ones appear daily.
