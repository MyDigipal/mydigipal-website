AI agents are transforming business operations. Unlike traditional chatbots that only respond to prompts, AI agents can reason, plan, and execute complex multi-step tasks autonomously—updating your CRM, sending emails, generating reports, and more.

According to [n8n's platform documentation](https://n8n.io/ai-agents/), AI Agents don't just respond to prompts—they take action. They can query APIs, update CRMs, send emails, file reports, and more—all autonomously and continuously.

This guide shows you how to build production-ready AI agents using n8n in 2026.

## What are AI agents?

AI Agents in n8n are autonomous workflows powered by AI that can make decisions, interact with apps, and execute tasks without constant human input.

### Agents vs. traditional automation

| Aspect | Traditional Automation | AI Agents |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| Decision making | Rule-based (if/then) | Reasoning + context |
| Adaptability | Fixed paths only | Dynamic responses |
| Error handling | Predefined rules | Intelligent recovery |
| Complexity | Simple linear flows | Multi-step reasoning |
| Learning | None | Improves with feedback |

### Core components of an AI agent

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| LLM (Brain) | Reasoning and decision making | Claude, GPT-4, Llama |
| Tools | Actions the agent can take | Send email, query database |
| Memory | Context from past interactions | Conversation history |
| Goals | Objectives to achieve | "Resolve customer inquiry" |
| Guardrails | Safety constraints | "Never share passwords" |

### Step-by-step setup

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Create new workflow | Start with blank canvas |
| 2 | Add trigger | Webhook for real-time, Schedule for batch |
| 3 | Add AI Agent node | Configure LLM connection |
| 4 | Define system prompt | Agent personality and rules |
| 5 | Add tools | Connect services agent can use |
| 6 | Configure memory | Enable conversation history |
| 7 | Set guardrails | Define boundaries |
| 8 | Test thoroughly | Validate all paths |

## Real-world agent applications
