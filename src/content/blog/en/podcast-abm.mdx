## Meet the experts

- **Bruce Eidsvik** - Former enterprise sales leader turned ABM strategist, bringing insights from both sides of the funnel
- **Alizee Varloud** - ABM program architect who has designed and executed campaigns for Fortune 500 companies
- **Paul Andre** - MyDigipal founder and B2B marketing veteran with expertise spanning [Google Ads](/en/services/google-ads), [Paid Social](/en/services/paid-social), and integrated ABM campaigns

## Episode deep dive

### The ABM reality check

According to [SiriusDecisions research](https://www.forrester.com/), **70% of ABM programs fail to meet expectations** in their first year. Our experts break down why this happens and what separates successful programs from the rest.

| Common ABM Failure | Root Cause | Solution Discussed |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Poor account selection | Relying on gut feeling vs. data | ICP development framework |
| Siloed execution | Sales and marketing misalignment | Shared metrics and cadences |
| One-size-fits-all content | Generic messaging to named accounts | Personalization at scale |
| Measurement gaps | Vanity metrics over pipeline impact | Revenue attribution models |

### Key topics covered

**1. Why Product-Led Growth (PLG) Isn't Enough**

Bruce opens with a provocative take on the PLG movement. While self-serve models work for certain products, enterprise B2B sales require human connection and personalized engagement. The data supports this:

- Enterprise deals involve **6-10 decision makers** on average ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey))
- **77% of B2B buyers** describe their purchase experience as complex
- Self-serve only captures a fraction of potential deal value

This is why a strategic [B2B & ABM approach](/en/services/b2b-abm) remains essential for high-value opportunities.

**2. Doing More with Less**

Paul addresses the elephant in the room: shrinking marketing budgets. With many companies facing resource constraints, the conversation shifts to prioritization:

- **Tier your accounts ruthlessly**: Not every named account deserves the same investment
- **Leverage intent data**: Focus energy on accounts showing buying signals
- **Automate the automatable**: Use technology for scale, humans for relationships
- **Measure what matters**: Attribution models that prove ROI to leadership

**3. Quality Over Quantity: The Paradigm Shift**

Alizee challenges the traditional lead generation mindset that has dominated B2B marketing for decades:

> "The number of MQLs you generate is meaningless if they never become customers. ABM forces us to focus on accounts that can actually become significant revenue."

This quality-first approach requires:

- Deep understanding of your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Multi-threaded engagement across the buying committee
- Patience—ABM is a marathon, not a sprint
- Alignment between sales and marketing on what "qualified" means

**4. AI and ABM: The 2024 Intersection**

The episode concludes with a forward-looking discussion on how artificial intelligence is transforming ABM:

- **Predictive account scoring**: Identifying which accounts are most likely to convert
- **Content personalization**: AI-generated variations tailored to specific personas
- **Intent signal processing**: Making sense of vast amounts of behavioral data
- **Conversation intelligence**: Mining sales calls for insights to improve messaging

4. **Measuring ABM success** - Moving beyond MQLs to pipeline influence and revenue attribution
5. **Scaling personalization** - Balancing 1:1 customization with operational efficiency
