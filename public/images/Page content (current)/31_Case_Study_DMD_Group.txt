MYDIGIPAL & DMD: DRIVING LEAD ACQUISITION THROUGH STRATEGIC SEA

THE CLIENT

DMD Group, a leader in the automotive industry in the Grand Ouest region since 1934, operates over 45 dealerships and offers a wide range of vehicles for both individuals and professionals.

Despite having strong and well-established SEO, ensuring quality organic visibility through a technically sound and well-structured website, the company sought our expertise. They aimed to maximize lead acquisition and optimize advertising performance by implementing a SEA strategy.

THE CHALLENGE

For DMD, our mission was to maximize the acquisition of high-quality leads by implementing a targeted SEA strategy. We structured this approach around three main pillars: Facebook ads, contact forms, and Google Ads campaigns.

OUR APPROACH

FACEBOOK ADS STRATEGY
With Facebook at the core of our strategy, we implemented targeted advertising campaigns to promote the catalog, special offers, and events, thereby increasing engagement among potential customers and reaching a broad audience.

Instead of launching a separate ad for each dealership, we revised our strategy to concentrate our budget on specific segments, such as new and used vehicles. This approach allows us to run fewer campaigns but optimize them more effectively, allocating a larger budget to achieve better results. 

Additionally, we utilize Facebook Dynamic Ads to efficiently promote the entire stock of used vehicles for the DMD group. These dynamic ads automatically display personalized advertisements based on users' behaviors and interests, enhancing our ability to reach potential customers with relevant offers and boosting conversion rates.

FACEBOOK DYNAMIC ADS FOR USED VEHICLES
To boost the sales of used vehicles, we synchronized the stock of used and demo vehicles from the website to a Facebook catalog. Throughout the campaign, we adjusted the budget allocation based on current business objectives, focusing on a specific brand, car type, model series, price range, mileage, etc.

We then activated remarketing so that when a user views a vehicle on the website, they see that same vehicle again on Facebook.

CONTACT FORMS OPTIMIZATION
The integration of optimized contact forms through DMD's Facebook campaigns has greatly enhanced lead capture. We ensured these forms were easily accessible and compelling, encouraging users to reach out to DMD for more information or to schedule a test drive at a dealership.

Over the course of a year, the forms utilized in Facebook campaigns generated:
• 1,630 leads total
• 20 orders resulting
• 12 new cars sold per 1,000 leads ratio
• 199% increase compared to the previous year
• 30% cost per lead reduction (from €34 to €24)

GOOGLE ADS CAMPAIGNS
Our Google Ads campaigns were designed to complement our Facebook efforts by targeting specific keywords and using personalized ads to attract a qualified audience. This approach allowed us to launch and manage multiple campaigns each year, optimizing performance in real-time to maximize results.

Beyond standard campaigns, we also integrated Performance Max into our Google Ads strategy, which significantly improved our results:
• 57% increase in conversions since the beginning of 2023
• 10,500 in-store visits in 2023
• Performance Max distinguished by its ability to serve ads across various placements (Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube)

MG BRAND LAUNCH CAMPAIGN
In anticipation of the arrival of new MG models, the DMD Group tasked us with creating ads to enhance their visibility in prospect searches on Google. We set up a campaign structure that utilized not only specific keywords related to the models but also competitor and generic keywords.

SEASONAL CAMPAIGNS
Digital presence on Google is crucial, especially during seasonal promotions like Christmas. Our strategic choice was a display campaign featuring captivating visuals to maximize the visual and emotional impact of seasonal offers. Using eye-catching visuals also helps stand out amidst the information overload during the holiday season.

TRACKING AND REPORTING
Given the complexity and high volume of the campaigns, we implemented rigorous conversion tracking to assess performance. Interactive reports were developed via Looker Studio, providing DMD with the ability to monitor results in real-time and adjust strategies accordingly. These reports are reviewed during monthly meetings with the DMD team, ensuring complete transparency and ongoing strategic planning.

THE RESULTS

Our efforts led to a significant increase in lead generation and improvement in advertising campaign performance for DMD:

• 170% increase in Total conversions compared to the previous period
• 150% increase in users by SEO improvements through Organic search
• 225% increase in users by Google Ads Paid search campaigns
• 85% increase in Website traffic
• 470 concrete automotive projects generated through Facebook

Our advertising campaigns for the year generated:
• 90,000 clicks
• 2.25 million impressions
• 4.0% CTR (Click-Through Rate)

CONCLUSION

With our expertise in SEA and a multichannel approach, the DMD Group has strengthened its online presence and maximized lead generation. By combining targeted Facebook campaigns with optimized Google ads, we provided DMD with a comprehensive and effective digital marketing strategy. 

We observed that SEA and SEO mutually reinforce each other: strong SEO improves SEA campaign effectiveness, while SEA campaigns boost SEO by increasing site visibility and relevance.
