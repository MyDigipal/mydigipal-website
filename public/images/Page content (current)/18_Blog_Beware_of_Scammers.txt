BEWARE OF SCAMMERS - PEOPLE IMPERSONATING MYDIGIPAL

Scammers are impersonating MyDigipal with fake job offers! They contact victims via WhatsApp & direct them to fraudulent sites. Stay alert & verify!

It has come to our attention that a group of scammers is impersonating MyDigipal to deceive individuals by offering fake job opportunities. Their scheme is highly elaborate, and they operate as follows:

🔹 They initially contact people via WhatsApp, pretending to be a recruitment agency part of MyDigipal group (Deluxe Recruitment is a name they've used for example).
🔹 They direct victims to fraudulent websites that closely resemble our official site
🔹 They offer easy online jobs that require no prior experience.
🔹 Very quickly, they start requesting money, and that's where the scam begins.

We have successfully taken down multiple fraudulent websites, but new ones appear daily. Below is a list of scam domains we have already reported and shut down:

Additionally, our company has no business dealings with the MYD Company and does not assume any legal responsibilities (myd-uganda.com)

If you come across any other website claiming to be MyDigipal, it is a scam. If you are ever in doubt, feel free to contact Paul directly for verification.

This type of fraud is unfortunately becoming more common among growing businesses. Our legal team sees this as a reflection of our company's rising reputation, but it is deeply troubling to know that people have lost significant amounts of money due to these scammers. We have been contacted by numerous victims through our lead form, and hearing their stories is heartbreaking.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
🔹 Be cautious, if someone claims to represent MyDigipal, verify their identity.
🔹 Report fraudulent websites or suspicious contacts directly to paul@mydigipal.com so they can be included in the ongoing police report.
🔹 If you have been a victim, we strongly recommend filing a report with Action Fraud UK.

Let's work together to put an end to these scams. If you have any information about these fraudulent activities, please share it so we can take further action. Stay safe and vigilant! 🔎⚠️
