FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q: What is Account Based Marketing in a nutshell?
A: Account-based marketing is a hyper-targeted growth strategy that brings sales and marketing teams together to create personalized campaigns delivered to an identified set of high-value target accounts.

Q: Who is ABM for?
A: Businesses who seek to engage with a specific ICP / Persona by leveraging the latest digital marketing initiatives available. Great for Tech / SaaS / Finance / Pharmaceutical, and much more industries in terms of lead identification and engagement.

Q: What channels are used in Account Based Marketing?
A: This largely depends on where your key accounts are. For a B2B account, we would expect LinkedIn to factor in as an important channel; there may be a need for paid search, email, and even a direct mail element. The critical part is understanding how we reach your audience in their preferred communication arena.

Q: How can you measure the ROI of Account Based Marketing?
A: It's simple. This is not a scattergun approach or a fishing exercise. It's so targeted, the sales teams will have their contact list of key accounts and be able to link up all new inquiries, new leads, and new business, as the campaign gets underway. As so much of the campaign is digital, we'll be able to measure response rates, conversions, and goals achieved too.

Q: Can you use marketing automation for your ABM campaigns?
A: You certainly can. It makes a huge amount of sense as it allows everything to be organized and flowing on time. Everyone (sales and marketing) has sight of everything at any given time and this means momentum continues unhindered and your audience gets the best experience.
