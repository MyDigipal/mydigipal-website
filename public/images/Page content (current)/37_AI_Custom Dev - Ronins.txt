AI AGENCY IN LONDON AND SURREY
Ronins is an AI automation agency helping businesses turn everyday tasks into self-running systems that save time and money.
Need help? Let’s talk AI
AI AUTOMATION AGENCY
Most teams already use AI without realising it, it’s built into the tools they log into every day. The problem is none of it talks to each other and no one’s owning the results. From our base in London and Surrey, we help founders and leadership teams make AI work across their business.

We’ve built chatbots, data agents and automations for sectors that still run on paper or people, whether is retail or healthcare, construction or education it really does not matter and once we find the repetitive process we can automate it to save hours of time and costs.

OUR APPROACH TO AI AGENT APPLICATIONS
What Success Looks Like
It’s when AI runs quietly in the background, doing the repetitive tasks enabling so you as business leaders and your team can focus on driving the company forwards. Whether it’s automating reports, routing leads, or surfacing insights for your sales team.

Problems We Solve
You’ve probably tried AI tools and struggled to understand your instructions or the data you gave it, then we you finally got it working you could not connect it to your existing systems or roll it out to everyone in the compa

We Optimise

AI BUSINESS
Our Point of View
AI isn’t the strategy, it’s the amplifier.

We don’t implement AI for the sake of it as the value’s not in the model, it’s in what it unlocks.

Most AI projects fail because they chase new AI functionality over fixing a real problem. AI Just like any software development project is down the defining the use cases and defining what’s costing time, where workflows go slow between departments and whats data you have that is being wasted.

We’ve built assistants, RAG tools and automations that real teams use every day, inside real businesses.
