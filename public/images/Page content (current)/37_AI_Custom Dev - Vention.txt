Trusted by the best
At Vention, we're proud to deliver transformative solutions to businesses — from trailblazing startups and forward-thinking SMBs to established Fortune 500 enterprises and everything in between.
AI and UK go hand in hand
The UK AI market is the third largest in the world, accounting for over 55 per cent of all AI-related investments in Europe.

 

The sector has already attracted £18.8B in private investments, solidifying the UK’s position as a global AI powerhouse. With one in six UK companies (432K businesses) already leveraging AI, the market is ripe for innovators ready to shape the future of technology.

Backing this momentum, the AI Opportunities Action Plan — supported by leading tech firms — has secured commitments of £14B towards groundbreaking AI projects, which reinforces the UK’s role as a leader in AI-driven transformation.

“AI is empowering organisations to make better, more informed decisions by leveraging new data sources that were previously overlooked.
This expanded access to insights enables businesses to refine their strategies and operations with unprecedented precision and foresight.”
How your industry can use AI
Still think AI doesn’t belong in your industry? Think again. With expertise across 30+ sectors, Vention helps businesses push boundaries and rewrite the rulebook with AI.

Be it bespoke software or refining off-the-shelf solutions, we’ve got you covered.

Fintech
For fintech companies, AI is the ultimate assistant — sharp, efficient, and always on duty. From calculating investment risks to making credit decisions, predicting market trends, and detecting fraud, AI turns raw financial data into golden insights that drive smarter business decisions.

Fraud detection 
Fraud is a fintech company’s worst nightmare. The solution? Intelligent fraud detection and prevention systems that use AI to find trends invisible to the naked eye and inform you of suspicious activities.

Risk management 
Even the most seasoned financial experts can miss a tiny but crucial detail in credit assessments, due diligence, or compliance checks. That’s the human factor AI can eliminate. Vention’s models pull data from social media, news, and custom sources to help you make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

Credit scoring 
Traditional CRA data often lacks context, leading to bad calls and lost customers. A custom AI-powered credit scoring system expands the dataset, factoring in alternative financial indicators to make fair, accurate decisions — even for customers just starting to build credit.

Portfolio management  
Investment firms, brokers, and trading platforms need real-time analytics and sharp forecasting tools. With AI-driven risk assessments and market-aware predictions, Vention builds intelligent portfolio management systems that give both new and seasoned investors the edge they need.

Algorithmic trading 
AI-driven algorithmic trading offers hands-free investing for customers who want their assets working for them. By processing vast amounts of market data in real time, AI identifies patterns and executes trades only when predefined conditions are met so your users can relax while AI does the heavy lifting.

Customer service 
Customers rarely read manuals — so why waste your support team’s time on repetitive queries? A custom AI chatbot handles FAQs, directs users to documentation, and assists with transactions, leaving human agents free to focus on complex issues that matter.

AI in action: our transformative projects driving change
Service
EliseAI
Vention helped a startup make the affordable rental housing crisis easier for both agents and prospects. To do so, we developed an AI-powered assistant that autonomously communicates with prospects and provides all the necessary information about properties. The outcomes? 90 percent of manual work automated, 30 percent faster client onboarding, and a 65 percent increase in conversions.

Service
motum
What happens when someone notices that vehicle claims and maintenance management still rely on old manual and paper-based processes? We help them change it. That’s how we got into a project for a SaaS platform that connects drivers, fleet managers, and service partners through one AI-powered service that detects damage and handles all the sensitive stuff, including notifications to insurance companies. With more than 8000 cars already serviced, our client is not planning to stop any time soon.

Service
Comet
When ML experts decide to launch a tool that would make all AI/ML developers’ lives easier, we say “Comet.” And to help them excel even further at that task, Vention equipped the product with tools for efficient monitoring and analysis of model training, integrated it with popular Python ML frameworks and libraries, and even helped the client launch an LLM initiative, a user-friendly API for proper visualisation of interactions with LLMs. As a result, we not only elevated AI development for really big brands but also set a new standard in LLM development.

Our clients say it best
They have done multiple projects around AI, ML, and VR spaces. We worked on leading-edge voice agent technology.

They recently built an AI agent with Ph.D.-level research and development skills; the result was a breakthrough for that industry. We’ve generated several recommendation engines for products in the VR space and are near selling a start-up built with Vention resources.”

Paul Steckler
Founder & Senior Partner, Ramp Catalyst

Our clients say it best
Vention supported the design and development of the WiseOwl MVP, an AI-powered school library platform.

Vention’s project management has been highly responsive and professional. They adapted quickly to evolving needs and handled scope changes thoughtfully. Deliverables have been on time, and the team has shown strong ownership and flexibility throughout. What impressed me most was that Vention didn’t just act as order takers... they approached the project like true partners. Their team brought thoughtful questions, creative problem-solving, and a clear understanding of our goals. They contributed strategic thinking, not just execution, and that made a huge difference in shaping the product.”

Jeff Frey
Co-Founder of WiseOwl Innovations, LLC

Our clients say it best
We are advertising technology. We hired Vention to build our complete platform enhance it with AI.

We gave them an idea and some designs and Vention turned it into our platform that 1000's of our clients use daily. It has been an amazing relationship that we plan to continue.”

Joe Marino
CEO at Ribeye

Our clients say it best
We develop and distribute artificial intelligence (AI) software to extract actionable intelligence for brands, and to detect abuse on the internet.

Despite our very niche and specialised application domain, the developer assigned to us has been doing a great job understanding our needs and developing a quality product.”

Vadim Berman
CEO, Tisane Labs

Our clients say it best
The model we chose is team extension, developers joining the core engineering team. We're happy with those additions to the team.

The programmers are a fantastic addition to the group. They were promptly integrated and brought up to speed. The level of expertise of the developers they let me interview is impressive. And the ones we eventually hired.”

CTO, Staircase AI

Seven pillars of the AI model development process
From the first byte of data to a market-ready AI solution, our approach ensures a seamless, efficient, and impact-driven journey.

01
Drafting the scope
We want your AI product to be successful. For these purposes, we do two things before starting the development process: learn which problem the AI product should solve and outline how it should solve it, including clear, measurable outcomes based on AI performance metrics we plan to meet.
