MARKETING AUTOMATION & TRACKING SOLUTIONS

B2B Marketing is complex. When B2C and e-commerce require directing a potential customer to a website to generate a sale, B2B often requires engaging multiple stakeholders throughout a lengthy buyer journey. To optimize this process, marketing automation is key.

WHAT IS MARKETING AUTOMATION?
Marketing automation uses technology to automate repetitive marketing work and provide strategic insights. Marketing departments can automate recurring tasks such as email marketing, social media posting, and even ad campaigns - not just for the sake of efficiency, but also to provide a more personalized experience for their prospects and customers. The technology behind marketing automation makes these tasks faster and easier to do.

WHAT IS IT USED FOR?

DATA COLLECTION AND INTELLIGENCE
Each of your prospects' actions is an added data point for your marketing strategy, telling you what customers are looking for, immediately in the moment. As helpful as this information is, manually tracking these intent signals and engagement behaviors is impossible. With marketing automation solutions, businesses use these signals from all sources to deep dive in their digital strategy. Start building your data collection to improve your campaign performance and overall results.

PERSONALIZED WORKFLOWS
Thanks to these data points, you can build personalized workflows to help drive qualified prospects to relevant content, resulting in warm leads that can then be nurtured thoughtfully into customers. Marketing automation doesn't stop there though. With the customer at the center of the flywheel, businesses can continue to engage customers with personalized workflows that lead to an improved loyalty and upsell.

ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
Build systems that work across different functional teams to personalize your campaigns to a next level. Learn from top performing paths to keep improving the main structure and ensure data accuracy / accessibility. Nothing more satisfying than implementing a unified customer experience right from the very first touch, all the way beyond the deal closing date.
