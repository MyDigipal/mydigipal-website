HOW TO TRAIN YOUR TEAM ON AI: SCALABLE METHODS AND USE CASES

Discover how to train your teams on AI tools with real use cases, prompting techniques and a scalable adoption plan. Start building AI readiness now.

1. WHY TRAINING YOUR TEAM ON USING AI IS A PRIORITY TODAY

We've entered a new era. AI isn't coming, it's already here. And it's not going away.

From content generation to data analysis, automation to language translation, AI is quietly (but radically) transforming the way work gets done. Across departments, it's already replacing repetitive, low-value tasks with faster, smarter processes.

The companies that embrace this shift gain a critical edge. They save time. Reduce errors. Move faster. Free their teams to focus on what really matters: creativity, strategy, and decision-making.

But those who hold back? They're not "playing it safe". They're choosing to forgo a massive opportunity for efficiency and innovation.

Giving your teams access to AI tools is no longer a luxury. It's a responsibility. It's a way to remove friction from everyday work, and to empower employees to spend their time on the tasks that truly deserve human insight.

But here's the catch: tools alone don't drive transformation. People do.

That's why training your teams is step one. Because without the skills, confidence and mindset to use AI well, the tools just sit idle. Or worse, they're used carelessly, reinforcing bad habits or compliance risks.

2. WHAT EMPLOYEES CAN DO WITH AI: USE CASES THAT MATTER

One of the biggest blockers to adoption is that AI still feels abstract. Training needs to ground it in the real world. Here are practical use cases that resonate across teams:

• Marketing & Comms: write LinkedIn posts, summarise reports, localise content into multiple languages, create first drafts for emails or campaigns
• Retail & Customer Care: respond to FAQs, summarise customer feedback, generate call scripts, translate product descriptions
• HR & Legal: draft job ads, summarise CVs, rephrase legal clauses, write interview recaps
• Finance & Operations: clean up Excel data, check formulas, generate dashboards, translate metrics into insights

In every case, AI is not replacing the team. It's a starting point. It drafts, organises, translates, rewrites. But it's the human that stays in control. This is the mindset we want to instil.

3. TRAINING PEOPLE TO PROMPT LIKE PROS: THE CRAFT METHOD

If you want your teams to get meaningful results from generative AI, you have to go beyond the basics. Most frustrations with tools like ChatGPT come from unclear or incomplete instructions.

Enter the CRAFT method, a simple structure we use in training to design better prompts:
• C – Context: What's the situation or background?
• R – Role: Who is the AI supposed to act as?
• A – Action: What do you want it to do?
• F – Format: What should the output look like?
• T – Tone: How should it sound?

For example: "You work in a healthcare company as a recruitment specialist. Write a job ad for a marketing analyst. Make it concise and friendly, formatted as a LinkedIn post."

This is vastly more effective than "Write a job ad".

Advanced prompting techniques:
• Iterative prompting (refining responses step-by-step)
• Reverse prompting (asking the AI how it would answer something, then adjusting)
• Style transfer (mimicking brand tone or voice)
• File-based prompts (working with PDFs, Excel, etc.)

4. PRACTICAL AI EXERCISES: BUILD SKILLS THROUGH HANDS-ON LEARNING

Two types of exercises to maximise learning impact:

INDIVIDUAL PROMPT CREATION (SOLO WORK)
Each participant drafts their own "base prompt" - a reusable instruction for a task they often perform. The goal here isn't perfection. It's about ownership: making participants think through how they want to brief an AI tool, and reflect on what works, what doesn't.

GROUP CHALLENGE: PROMPTING WITH CREATIVITY AND ITERATION
Teams of 3–4 people use prompting techniques and multiple iterations to achieve an output together. For example:
• Rephrase an internal email
• Translate it into another language
• Create an image to go with it
• Turn the content into a PDF report
• Extract key actions and write a summary for Slack

This is about exploration: testing, tweaking, and learning by doing. The best outcomes often come from bold and playful experimentation.

5. SECURE AND ACCESSIBLE AI TOOLS FOR EVERYONE

Once training is complete, it's crucial not to leave teams in the dark. The next step is about enabling them with the right environment to apply what they've learned.

Companies should provide a centralised, enterprise-level AI solution—like ChatGPT Enterprise, Microsoft Copilot, or any AI assistant integrated within their existing tech stack. This ensures that employees have a safe environment in which to experiment with AI using real, sometimes sensitive, internal documents.

6. BUILD AN INTERNAL AI COUNCIL TO DRIVE ADVANCED ADOPTION

Beyond individual usage, every AI-literate company needs a team responsible for developing more complex, custom solutions. That's where an AI Council comes in.

This cross-functional group could include internal profiles already working on data, analytics, or automation, or new hires with foundational AI knowledge. Their role is to go beyond prompting and experiment with advanced integrations: API connections, autonomous agents, workflow automation, and more.

Their job is to listen to employees' pain points and identify bottlenecks that AI can solve. They should act like internal consultants. Each project should follow a simple cycle: listen to users → build → test → gather feedback → iterate.

CONCLUSION: FROM AI TRAINING TO LONG-TERM IMPACT

Bringing AI into an organisation isn't just a matter of tech deployment. It's a transformation in how people think, work and create value.

With the right training, teams move from passive users to proactive experimenters. They start seeing AI not as a threat, but as a collaborator. One that helps them write faster, decide smarter, and build better.

But impact doesn't happen overnight. The companies that truly succeed are those that treat AI enablement as a journey, not a one-off workshop.

Here's what that journey looks like:
• It starts with relevance - Use cases that resonate with each team's reality
• It grows through capability - Structured training in prompting and advanced techniques
• It scales with support - Tools made accessible in secure environments
• It deepens through collaboration - Group challenges, peer learning, internal champions
• It accelerates with structure - An internal AI Council focused on solving real workflow issues

More than anything, adoption sticks when employees feel confident. When they're given the right guardrails—and the freedom to explore.

At MyDigipal, we help organisations embed AI where it matters most: in people's daily work. Because real transformation starts at the team level—and scales from there.
