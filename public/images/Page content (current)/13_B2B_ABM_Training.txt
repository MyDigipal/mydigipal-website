PERSONALISED ABM WORKSHOP

ACCOUNT-BASED MARKETING TRAINING
Get started or ramp up your Account-Based Marketing with our personalised ABM training packages.

Account-Based Marketing is super efficient, but it's also difficult to implement. We get it. Amazing brands hear about ABM, want to get started with it, but quickly face walls such as "Where to start? What tools should I get? Which team should I involve? How much budget should I allocate?"

We've launched dozens of ABM programs and like to involve our clients in the thought process of our projects. So we thought, why not make the most of it by offering support to companies seeking a personalized consultancy for their ABM program?

WHAT IS ABM?
B2B marketers have tried multiple strategies in the past few decades. From traditional field marketing strategies with events, trade shows, and mass emails, they then move to inbound marketing, creating content and leveraging social media to engage with prospects.

However, they tend to struggle to identify high-value prospects, create relevant content, and generate ROI.

This is where account-based marketing (ABM) comes in.

Account-based marketing (ABM) is a hyper-targeted growth strategy that empowers marketers to identify high-value target audiences and to create and deliver personalized content to reach better performance.

WHY SHOULD YOU GET AN ABM WORKSHOP?
Getting external ABM support is great because you get expertise and it will be faster to implement. However, investing in training your internal team will ensure that you have no dependency to external providers and you can get full ownership of your ABM programs while upskilling your teams. We specialize in training marketing, growth and sales teams on ABM programs so you feel confident to launch and run programs internally. And if you still need our help and support to QA, we're always an email away.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q: What is Account Based Marketing in a nutshell?
A: Account-based marketing is a hyper-targeted growth strategy that brings sales and marketing teams together to create personalized campaigns delivered to an identified set of high-value target accounts.

Q: Who is ABM for?
A: Businesses who seek to engage with a specific ICP / Persona by leveraging the latest digital marketing initiatives available. Great for Tech / SaaS / Finance / Pharmaceutical, and much more industries in terms of lead identification and engagement.

Q: What channels are used in Account Based Marketing?
A: This largely depends on where your key accounts are. For a B2B account, we would expect LinkedIn to factor in as an important channel; there may be a need for paid search, email, and even a direct mail element.

Q: How can you measure the ROI of Account Based Marketing?
A: It's simple. This is not a scattergun approach or a fishing exercise. It's so targeted, the sales teams will have their contact list of key accounts and be able to link up all new inquiries, new leads, and new business, as the campaign gets underway.

Q: Can you use marketing automation for your ABM campaigns?
A: You certainly can. It makes a huge amount of sense as it allows everything to be organized and flowing on time. Everyone (sales and marketing) has sight of everything at any given time and this means momentum continues unhindered and your audience gets the best experience.
