HOW DO FACEBOOK CATALOG ADS WORK?
Facebook Dynamic Ads use a product data feed to automatically sync vehicle details (images, prices, models, features, etc.) with your ads. This feed is continuously updated to ensure the ads accurately reflect your inventory. Once integrated into the Facebook Catalog, the ads are dynamically generated to target the right audience at the right time, maximizing your chances of conversion.
