HOW TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL LINKEDIN STRATEGY

Discover key strategies for a potent B2B LinkedIn presence, from precise targeting to content that converts. Get started on efficient campaigns now.

LinkedIn has consistently been a reliable and efficient B2B channel. The main advantage that LinkedIn offers is the targeting. Very few other channels offer the ability to precisely target companies, industries, or specific job titles, which is very powerful for B2B companies. But LinkedIn can also be expensive, and it is hard to provide a positive ROI. In this article, we will give you tips on how to implement a successful LinkedIn strategy.

TARGET THE RIGHT AUDIENCE

The starting point of a successful LinkedIn strategy is to find the right targeting. It needs to be broad enough to have the scale that LinkedIn needs to drive results, but it shouldn't be too broad, otherwise the audience will not be qualified enough. LinkedIn usually recommends the minimum size to be 50k+ but we tend to see good results from 15k onwards. For this, you can leverage LinkedIn filters, but we also strongly recommend leveraging first-party data and contact lists to make sure that your audience is targeted, relevant, and worth paying for.

On our examples, we're crossing Job functions, seniorities, interests, company list and exclusion. There's no such thing a magic recipe as you can copy & paste from a campaign to another. Your role is to find the combination that works best by AB testing your audiences. Different audience sizes will bring different outcomes.

That's where a good LinkedIn Ads Management comes into place.

LEVERAGE RETARGETING

Another targeting tip that we have for you is to leverage retargeting. We recommend not only retargeting prospects that visited your website, but also retargeting prospects that interacted with other, top-of-the-funnel ads and creating a funnel experience within LinkedIn to warm up your prospects with relevant content.

Create remarketing audiences that indicate a specific interest. First start with a generic remarketing audience that captures all visitors in the last 30 days. Then create sub-remarketing audiences based on content type (users who have visited XYZ pages, spent more than 2 minutes on your website etc…).

That will allow you to serve content that's more personalized to your audience.

PROVIDE CUSTOM AND VALUABLE CONTENT

LinkedIn is competitive and the attention span of your prospects is short. You need to be able to create and serve customized and valuable content to your prospects. They need to get something out of your content that will help them in their role. Spending time to understand your target audience's pain points and come up with content, copy, and visuals that will strongly resonate with them is key to a successful LinkedIn presence.

LEVERAGE ORGANIC CONTENT AND THOUGHT-LEADERSHIP ADS

A successful LinkedIn strategy does not only rely on company ads. Organic content and thought-leadership ads are also a great way to build a more organic and personalized experience for your audience. It comes across as more genuine, less pushy, and more helpful to your audience. Leverage these channels in parallel to boost your ads performance and overall efficiency.

When one of your blog post truly resonates with your audience, LinkedIn offers the possibility to boost this content to a bigger audience by adding a budget behind it. That's called LinkedIn Ad Boosting.

As time goes, every social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram have their organic visibility decreasing in favor of paid ads. If you want your content to be seen, it's a sacrifice we recommend going through.

TRACK AND ITERATE

Finally, tracking and iterating on your campaigns is key. LinkedIn can be expensive, but if it brings high-tickets deals and high-quality leads, it can be justified. On the other hand, if the quality of the lead and engagement is low, your LinkedIn investment might not make sense. Therefore, tracking your overall ROI, average deal size, and lead quality is key, and iterating on your content, copies, and creatives to test, learn, and improve is a great way to ensure optimal ROI on this channel.

We recommend having two robust tracking in place:
• Your website tracking - Having LinkedIn Insight tag implemented in a proper way on your website to track all user interactions and feed this back to LinkedIn. Important note: make sure this tag is compliant with Consent mode V2 as this becomes mandatory from March 2024.
• A strong automation system for your lead flow - When a lead gets in your system, it's important for your tools to grab all its details, as well as starting a scoring system. As your lead progresses in the funnel, serve personalized content to trigger engagement, leading to conversions.

We pride on having the right tracking & automation systems before getting your campaigns up and running.

CONCLUSION

While LinkedIn can be challenging to use and get a positive ROI, it remains an extremely powerful B2B channel offering unique targeting capabilities. Used efficiently and hand-in-hand with an organic and personalized experience, it can provide great efficiency for B2B companies.
