### Empowered Marketing Strategy through Mydigipal

We were looking to improve our digital marketing efforts, but had a gap in the marketing team and over 12 internal tools to handle all digital marketing aspects. MyDigipal was able to overcome significant challenges, clearing the backlog of digital support in the regions, and successfully executed an ABM revamp across LinkedIn. Very Impressive.

## Frequently Asked Questions



Account-based marketing is a hyper-targeted growth strategy that brings sales and marketing teams together to create personalized campaigns delivered to an identified set of high-value target accounts



Businesses who seek to engage with a specific ICP / Persona by leveraging the latest digital marketing initiatives available. Great for Tech / SaaS / Finance / Pharmaceutical, and much more industries in terms of lead identification and engagement



This largely depends on where your key accounts are. For a B2B account, we would expect LinkedIn to factor in as an important channel; there may be a need for paid search, email, and even a direct mail element. The critical part is understanding how we reach your audience in their preferred communication arena – as we’ve said already on this page, it’s about truly aligning your business with their business to get the best possible outcome



It’s simple. This is not a scattergun approach or a fishing exercise. It’s so targeted, the sales teams will have their contact list of key accounts and be able to link up all new inquiries, new leads, and new business, as the campaign gets underway. As so much of the campaign is digital, we’ll be able to measure response rates, conversions, and goals achieved too



You certainly can. It makes a huge amount of sense as it allows everything to be organized and flowing on time. Everyone (sales and marketing) has sight of everything at any given time and this means momentum continues unhindered and your audience gets the best experience
