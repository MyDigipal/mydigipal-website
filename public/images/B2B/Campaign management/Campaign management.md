## What's involved in Campaign Management

Campaign management refers to all the tasks related to running a paid media campaign. It includes the setup of the audiences, ads, and budgets, the daily tracking of performances and optimizations, as well as regular reporting cadences and recommendations. The multiple steps are listed down that page

## How can I run efficient B2B paid media campaigns?

While paid media is part of a broader B2B marketing strategy, it is instrumental at every stage of the funnel:

### Awareness

Paid media helps you reach your target audience audience at scale. With powerful and memorable brand ads, increase your brand awareness and create excitement around your brand and products

### Consideration

Your audience needs to be educated. In a lot of cases, they are either not aware of an issue they have or don’t know how to solve it. With paid media, you can engage your audience with short-form and informative content

### Lead-generation

Paid media is also a great way to generate leads through value-gated content. Ebooks, white papers, webinar recordings, and industry reports are valuable sources of information for your audience that they are willing to trade their contact details for

### Engagement

The role of paid media doesn’t end when you are able to generate a lead. It’s also a fantastic way to engage with your prospects to make them move through the funnel or to upsell existing customers

### Empowered Marketing Strategy through Mydigipal

We were looking to improve our digital marketing efforts, but had a gap in the marketing team and over 12 internal tools to handle all digital marketing aspects. MyDigipal was able to overcome significant challenges, clearing the backlog of digital support in the regions, and successfully executed an ABM revamp across LinkedIn. Very Impressive.
