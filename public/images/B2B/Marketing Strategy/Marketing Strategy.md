## What is a marketing strategy?

Effective B2B marketing is difficult to get right. Between creative demands, budget limits, and channel decisions, marketers have a lot to juggle when developing their marketing strategy. The biggest determinant of effective marketing, however, is your audience. We help you define and understand your target audience to then define how you can reach them

## What makes a good B2B marketing strategy?

Marketing to businesses is very different from marketing to individual consumers. B2B marketing targets the needs, interests, and challenges of individuals who are making purchases on behalf of, or for, their organization (rather than for themselves), thus making the organization the customer. In B2B, the marketing needs to address the following:

Focused on ROI, efficiency, and expertise

### Empowered Marketing Strategy through Mydigipal

We were looking to improve our digital marketing efforts, but had a gap in the marketing team and over 12 internal tools to handle all digital marketing aspects. MyDigipal was able to overcome significant challenges, clearing the backlog of digital support in the regions, and successfully executed an ABM revamp across LinkedIn. Very Impressive.

This largely depends on where your key accounts are. For a B2B account, we would expect LinkedIn to factor in as an important channel; there may be a need for paid search, email, and even a direct mail element. The critical part is understanding how we reach your audience in their preferred communication arena – as we’ve said already on this page, it’s about truly aligning your business with their business to get the best possible outcome.
