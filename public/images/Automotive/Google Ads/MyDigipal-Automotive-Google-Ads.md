### Google Ads: Highest Return on investment solution for car dealerships

Google Ads is the most effective channel for reaching customers because it leverages user intent. When a potential buyer searches for a specific model or brand, you can present them with tailored content that meets their needs.

Although major car manufacturers also use Google Ads, the local and personal touch of your dealership gives you a competitive edge.

Additionally, integrating Google Ads with your social media campaigns can enhance your reach and performance. For optimal results and detailed strategies, visit our dedicated page.

## Used Cars

Reach your prospects with a personalised approach

### Personalized & qualified audience

Promote used cars based on the target audience. Need to sell cars from a particular brand? Request a specific filter and only show ads for that category.

Otherwise, let Google's algorithm associate searches with offers from your dealership

### Positioning your dealership as the top choice

Target particular brands and models when you have a large stock, or target more generic keywords (buy used car less than €10,000, used leboncoin, lacentrale, etc.)

Be in pole position on Google for used car searches:

Position yourself as the solution of choice for prospects who are actively looking for a used car.

section 3

## Events

Driving success: Leveraging events in your dealership

### Positive Dealership Engagement

Events such as open days, clearance sales or the inauguration of a new model associate your dealership with positive values among prospects.

Promoting your events on Google also allows you to obtain more participations and registrations.

Let us choose the audience who demonstrates an interest in an automotive project, or target people you already know.
